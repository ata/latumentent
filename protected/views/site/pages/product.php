<p>Apartments.com recently conducted a survey to current renters about decorating, 
ninety percent of renters will decorate when moving to a new apartment; and of these 
renters, eighty-one percent will decorate within the first three months of their move.</p>

<p>Most renters said that their biggest decorating challenge is staying within a budget (38%). 
Other survey respondents stated their challenges when decorating include: not having enough 
space (23%), need help with organization (12%) and unsure of what colors to use (12%).</p>

<p>In our survey, we also found that the majority of renters, sixty-five percent, 
plan to spend $500 or less on their decorating budget while eighteen percent of 
respondents will spend between $500 and $1000.</p>

<p>But decorating does not have to break the bank, as Eva the Shopping Diva, 
shopping expert and blogger from ShopLocal, offers this advice for renters decorating on a budget:</p>

<p>First try a small yet important room, like the bathroom. Simply hanging a new shower curtain with 
a gorgeous pattern can really change the look of the room. Add a great bath mat that compliments 
the pattern and a new look is born.</p>
<p>Re-covering old dining room chairs or a worn-out ottoman are easy ways to subtly change the 
style of a room. Select a fabulous fabric and use a staple gun to give old furniture a new life.</p>
<p>Wall decals are a snap to apply and if you get tired of them you can easily peel them off. 
You can get very creative with this great alternative to wallpaper.</p>
